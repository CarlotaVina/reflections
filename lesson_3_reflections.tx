When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When, the repository is shared with other people different my local team



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When you dont't want to share Git repository and you want to other people do modifications in your files before to pull in Git
