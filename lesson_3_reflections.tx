How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I think to collaborate you have to use a repository where to manage the different versions of programs. Without using contro version program you have to send the programs by email each time you do a modification. Using git and github is easier to communicate the changes other people. Manage conflicts can be the hardest.
